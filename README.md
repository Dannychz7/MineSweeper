Few disclaimers about the project: 
1. Most of the files were created and owned by myself with an exception of a few files.

3. Files not written by myself:
     - Timer.java
     - StatusBox.java
     - HelpBox.java
Description: The premise of the video game is a replica of the minsweeper game. The game was written in JAVA, there are mines which are randomly placed through the map and increase as the difficulty increase.
